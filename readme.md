# megalinref - Mega-fast Linear Referencing <!-- omit in toc -->

Python module for converting between lat/lon and road/chainage.
Built in Rust ‚öôÔ∏è for the mega-speed you deserve üòâ

1. Convert coordinates road number, carriageway and SLKs,
1. Convert SLK observations converted into coordinates
   - Previously I implemented a pure Rust server for this purpose; see <https://github.com/thehappycheese/nicklinref_rust>

## 1. Development Progress

This library is in early stages of development. Road map below:

- [x] Get rust to build, and python to import
- [x] Get data downloaded in python
- [x] Get GeoJSON passed into rust data structure
  - [ ] Get rust to serialize and compress its internal data structure
- [ ] Insert geometry into some sort of RTree structure
- [ ] Get reverse spatial lookup working
  - [ ] lat/lon to Road/Cwy/SLK, one point at a time
  - [ ] lat/lon to Road/Cwy/SLK, from numpy array of coordinates
- [ ] Get forward spatial lookup working
  - [ ] Road/Cwy/SLK to lat/lon, one point at a time
  - [ ] Road/Cwy/SLK to numpy array of coordinates
- [ ] Publish on Conda-Forge with windows binaries
  - [ ] Publish anylinux binaries (if it ever seems like enough people might use the package)

## 2. Usage / Examples

The interface is currently awful and messy, but it will look something like this:

```python
import megalinref
from megalinref.megalinref import SLKLookup

xx = megalinref.data_handling._download_fresh_data_as_json(chunk_limit=None))

slk_lookup = SLKLookup(xx)

(road, cwy, slk) = slk_lookup.lookup(lat=-31.956598, lon=115.8773259)

```

## 3. Why write a Python Library in Rust?

`megalinref` brings all the functionality of my [previous projects](#4-previous-projects) to into Python
- by the power of a single `import`,
- without sacrificing any speed to `geopandas`,
- with no clunky backends
- or having to deal with web requests.

There are downsides: Building this library using Rust means there will be trouble distributing binaries. Most likely this will only work on x64 Windows for the forseeable future, and distributing the binaries will be difficult. Perhaps it can be deployed to conda-forge.

## 4. Previous Projects

### 4.1. linrefreverse

<https://github.com/thehappycheese/linrefreverse>

- a python library to convert lat/lon to SLK
  - It is slow and uses loads of ram.
  - It depends on `geopandas` `SpatialIndex.nearest()` which in turn depends on `pygeos` or `rtree`.
    - Geopandas itself seems to hog tonnes of ram somehow
    - I think i tested and found `rtree` only handles point objects, not lines?? I dont know why it wasn't working
    - pygeos depends on the legendary GEOS C++ package. Pretty sure this handled linestrings and did the job nice and fast. But pygeos is an optional dependancy and you have to set flags in geopandas to enable it as the default backend. Don't like.

### 4.2. nicklinref_rust

<https://github.com/thehappycheese/nicklinref_rust>

- A pure Rust web service that converts Road Name & SLK into lat/lon
  - This is super fast, but has the drawback of generating lots of network traffic when not running at localhost, and just generally being difficult to deploy. Also, making web requests can sometimes get in the way of the task at hand.
