# megalinref - Mega-fast Linear Referencing

A Python module built in rust for the mega-speed you deserve.

When you need to get stonking horks of road SLK observations converted to coordinates,
or you need a fat stack of coordinates converted to road SLKs, this is the python library for you.

Building this library using Rust means we will have trouble distributing binaries. Most likely this will only work on x64 Windows for the forseeable future, and distributing the binaries will be difficult. Perhaps we can deploy to conda-forge.
