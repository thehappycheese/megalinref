# megalinref - Mega-fast Linear Referencing <!-- omit in toc -->

Python module for converting between lat/lon and road/chainage.
Built in Rust ‚öôÔ∏è for the mega-speed you deserve üòâ

1. Convert coordinates road number, carriageway and SLKs,
1. Convert SLK observations converted into coordinates
   - Previously I implemented a pure Rust server for this purpose; see <https://github.com/thehappycheese/nicklinref_rust>

## 1. Development Progress

This library is in early stages of development. Road map below:

- [x] Get rust to build, and python to import
- [x] Get data downloaded in python
- [x] Get GeoJSON passed into rust data structure
  - [x] Get rust to serialize and compress its internal data structure
  - [ ] Confirm binary caching is working
- [ ] Get reverse spatial lookup working
  - [ ] Insert geometry into some sort of RTree structure
    - [ ] Make it actually perform as fast as I expected :( this is turning out to be pretty hard.
  - [x] Gave up on the RTree structure, brute force parallel with `rayon` works better :/
    - Available libraries in the ecosystem (I tried `rstar`) seem ill equipped to deal with ~ 250 MB of linestrings. The memory usage just explodes beyond reasonable limits (5GB+) and I was not able to insert the entire road network.
    - I don't really want to try the rust `GEOS` bindings. I doubt I can do any better than the already existing `shapely` library if I must resort to that.
  - [x] map lat/lon to Road/Cwy/SLK, one point at a time
  - [ ] map lat/lon to Road/Cwy/SLK, from numpy array of coordinates
  - [x] implement filters for state road / cwy etc
- [ ] Get forward spatial lookup working
  - [ ] Build hash table based on road number
  - [ ] map Road/Cwy/SLK to lat/lon, one point at a time
  - [ ] map Road/Cwy/SLK to numpy array of coordinates
- [ ] Publish on Conda-Forge with windows binaries
  - [ ] Publish anylinux binaries (if it ever seems like enough people might use the package, or if I need to use it on some cloud platform)

## 2. Installation

See the [releases](https://github.com/thehappycheese/megalinref/releases) page for instructions on how to install each release.

## 3. Usage / Examples

The following is subject to change in future releases:

```python
import megalinref as mlr

data       = mlr.download_fresh_data_as_json()

slk_lookup = mlr.SLKLookup(data)

result     = slk_lookup.lookup(
    lat=-31.89006203575722,
    lon=115.80183730752809,
    cwy=mlr.Cwy["L"] | mlr.Cwy["R"],
    network_type=mlr.NetworkType["State Road"] | mlr.NetworkType["Local Road"] 
)

assert result == {
    'feature': {
        'ROAD': 'H016',
        'CWY': 4,
        'START_SLK': 9.84,
        'END_SLK': 10.68,
        'START_TRUE_DIST': 9.84,
        'END_TRUE_DIST': 10.68,
        'NETWORK_TYPE': 1
    },
    'slk': 9.99999981522603,
    'true': 9.99999981522603,
    'distance': 1.064734332392196e-14
}
```

## 4. Why write a Python Library in Rust?

`megalinref` brings all the functionality of my [previous projects](#6-previous-projects) to into Python

- by the power of a single `import`,
- without sacrificing any speed to `geopandas`,
- with no clunky backends
- or having to deal with web requests.

There are downsides: Building this library using Rust means there will be trouble distributing binaries. Most likely this will only work on x64 Windows for the forseeable future, and distributing the binaries will be difficult. Perhaps it can be deployed to conda-forge.

## 5. Setup for Development

### 5.1. Initial Setup

These instructions assume you already have python 3.9+, rust and cargo installed.

The following commands will create and activate a virtual environment in the folder `.env/`

```console
python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv
python -m venv .env
.\.env\Scripts\activate
```

Next we need a build tool called maturin (see documentation [PyO3/maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin)) installed into the virtual environment.

```console
pip install maturin
```

To make this jupyter notebook work we need:

```console
pip install ipykernel
```

And to run the tests in this package we need:

```console
pip install pytest
```

### 5.2. Build using `maturin`

build for testing using

```console
maturin develop --release
```

or build wheel using

```console
maturin build --interpreter python
```

> NOTE: I had to add the `--interpreter python` flag since apparently `maturin` looks for the `py` launcher on the `PATH` and in my case there is no such launcher installed.

## 6. Previous Projects

### 6.1. linrefreverse

<https://github.com/thehappycheese/linrefreverse>

- a python library to convert lat/lon to SLK
  - It is slow and uses loads of ram.
  - It depends on `geopandas` `SpatialIndex.nearest()` which in turn depends on `pygeos` or `rtree`.
    - `geopandas` itself seems to hog tonnes of ram somehow
    - I think i tested and found `rtree` only handles point objects, not lines?? I dont know why it wasn't working
    - pygeos depends on the legendary `GEOS` C++ package. Pretty sure this handled linestrings and did the job nice and fast. But `pygeos` is an optional dependancy and you have to set flags in `geopandas` to enable it as the default backend. Don't like.

### 6.2. nicklinref_rust

<https://github.com/thehappycheese/nicklinref_rust>

- A pure Rust web service that converts Road Name & SLK into lat/lon
  - This is super fast, but has the drawback of generating lots of network traffic when not running at localhost, and just generally being difficult to deploy. Also, making web requests can sometimes get in the way of the task at hand.
