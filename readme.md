# megalinref - Mega-fast Linear Referencing <!-- omit in toc -->

Python module for converting between lat / lon and road / chainage.

This project is currently focused only on the Main Roads Western Australia Road Network which is
freely avaliable for download [here](https://portal-mainroads.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mainroads::road-network/about),
this library includes a utility function to grab that data as demonstrated in the example below.

Uses Rust binaries in the backend for the mega-speed you deserve :)

1. Convert (latitude, longitude) into (road_number, carriageway, slk),
2. Convert (road_number, slk) into (latitude, longitude)
   - For this task, you can also check out my other project [nicklinref_rust](https://github.com/thehappycheese/nicklinref_rust) which exposes similar functionality as a web service

## 1. Development Progress

This library is in early stages of development. Road map below:

- [x] Get rust to build, and python to import
- [x] Get data downloaded in python
- [x] Get GeoJSON passed into rust data structure
  - [x] Get rust to serialize and compress its internal data structure
  - [x] Confirm binary caching is working
- [x] Get reverse spatial lookup working
  - [ ] Insert geometry into some sort of RTree structure for high speed
    - [ ] Make the RTree structure it actually perform as fast as I expected :(
      this is turning out to be pretty hard.
  - [x] Gave up on the RTree structure, brute force parallel with `rayon` works
    better :/
    - Available libraries in the ecosystem (I tried `rstar`) seem ill equipped
      to deal with ~ 250 MB of linestrings. The memory usage just explodes
      beyond reasonable limits (5GB+) and I was not able to insert the entire
      road network. I think i may have been having some other kind of technical
      problem at the time... perhaps i can try again.
    - I don't really want to try the rust `GEOS` bindings. I doubt I can do any
      better than the already existing `shapely` library if I must resort to
      that.
  - [x] map lat/lon to Road/Cwy/SLK, one point at a time
  - [ ] map lat/lon to Road/Cwy/SLK, from numpy array of coordinates
  - [x] implement filters for state road / cwy etc
  - [ ] implement filters for specific road (so we don't accidentally match a
    side road when a coordinate happens at an intersection)
- [x] Get forward spatial lookup working
  - [x] Build hash table based on road number
  - [x] map Road/Cwy/SLK to lat/lon, one point at a time
  - [ ] map Road/Cwy/SLK to numpy array of coordinates
- [ ] Publish on Conda-Forge with windows binaries
  - [ ] Publish anylinux binaries (if it ever seems like enough people might use
    the package, or if I need to use it on some cloud platform)

## 2. Installation

See the [releases](https://github.com/thehappycheese/megalinref/releases) page
for instructions on how to install each release.

## 3. Usage / Examples

### 3.1. Setup

The following steps are required to set-up a `Lookup` object which will be used
in all subsequent examples

```python
from megalinref import (
    Lookup,
    Cwy,
    NetworkType,
    open_from_cache_or_download,
)

slk_lookup = open_from_cache_or_download("road_network.bin")
```

### 3.2. Use `road_slk_from_coordinate`

The following example takes a Latitude / Longitude coordinate and returns the nearest Road and SLK. Note that the `'feature'` refers to the nearest chunk of the road network, and the `slk` property gives the nearest chainage on that chunk.

```python
result = slk_lookup.road_slk_from_coordinate(
    lat           = -31.89006203575722,
    lon           = 115.80183730752809,
    carriageways  = Cwy["L"] | Cwy["R"],
    network_types = NetworkType["State Road"] | NetworkType["Local Road"],
    roads         = []
)
print(result)
```

```text
{
    'feature': {
        'ROAD': 'H016',
        'CWY': 'Left',
        'START_SLK': 9.84,
        'END_SLK': 10.68,
        'START_TRUE_DIST': 9.84,
        'END_TRUE_DIST': 10.68,
        'NETWORK_TYPE': 'State Road'
    },
    'slk': 10.000,
    'true': 10.000,
    'distance_metres': 0.000
}
```

### 3.3. Use `coordinate_from_road_slk`

The Following example takes a Road Number and SLK (Straight Line Kilometer, a.k.a. Chainage) and returns a Latitude Longitude point.
Please note that the return value may include multiple points if there are multiple carriageways. The format of the returned value is subject to change as I continue to work on this project.

```python
# now lets lookup a lat/lon based on a road/slk
result = slk_lookup.coordinate_from_road_slk(
    road         = "H016",
    slk          = 8.5,
    carriageways = Cwy["L"]
)
print(result)
```

```text
[[(115.81402235326775, -31.897493888518945)]]
```

### 3.4. Use `linestring_from_road_slk`

ðŸš§ NOTE: This function isn't working yet! It does not properly slice the linestring at slk_from and slk_to! ðŸš§

ðŸš§ Please check back later as I hope to fix this soon, or if you are keen to help come help me contribute to the underlying rust library <https://github.com/georust/geo> ðŸ˜€ ðŸš§

The following example (when it is working properly) will take a Road Number and a road section defined by a starting SLK and an ending SLK.
The result will be a LineString (array of coordinates) representing the road centreline which has been accuratly truncated to the starting and ending SLK. If there are multiple carriageways in the result then multiple LineStrings will be returned.

```python
result = slk_lookup.linestring_from_road_slk(
    road         = "H013",
    slk_from     = 15.06,
    slk_to       = 15.20,
    carriageways = mlr.Cwy["S"],
    offset       = 0,
)
print(result)
```

```text

[[[(115.76531688239908, -32.04096302748923),
(115.76413787234668, -32.04097693587323)],
[(115.76413787234668, -32.04097693587323),
(115.76327106891421, -32.04099304031786)]]]
```

> the result type will be improved in future; currently you get line strings
> with tuple coordinates nested and segmented awkwardly.

## 4. Why write a Python Library in Rust?

`megalinref` brings all the functionality of my [previous projects](#6-previous-projects) to into Python

- by the power of a single `import`,
- without sacrificing any speed to `geopandas`,
- with no clunky backends
- or having to deal with web requests.

There are downsides: Building this library using Rust means there will be trouble distributing binaries. Most likely this will only work on x64 Windows for the forseeable future, and distributing the binaries will be difficult. Perhaps it can be deployed to conda-forge.

## 5. Setup for Development

### 5.1. Initial Setup

These instructions assume you already have python 3.9+, rust and cargo installed.

The following commands will create and activate a virtual environment in the folder `.env/`

```console
python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
python -m pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv
python -m venv .env
```

Activate the new environment on windows;

```powershell
.\.env\Scripts\activate
```

Or on linux;

```bash
source .env/bin/activate
```

Next we need a build tool called maturin (see documentation [PyO3/maturin](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin)) installed into the virtual environment.

```bash
pip install maturin
```

To make jupyter notebooks work, and to run tests also do:

```bash
pip install ipykernel pytest dictdiffer
```

### 5.2. Install Rust Toolchain


Follow the guidance to [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on the Rust website

> NOTE: Nightly rust is currently required

> NOTE: To build on Amazon Linux there are some extra steps to install some development dependancies which are missing by default:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
sudo yum update
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
```


### 5.3. Build using `maturin`

build for testing using

```console
maturin develop --release
```

or build wheel using

```console
maturin build --release --interpreter python
```

> NOTE: I had to add the `--interpreter python` flag since apparently `maturin` looks for the `py` launcher on the `PATH` and in my case there is no such launcher installed.

## 6. Previous Projects

### 6.1. linrefreverse

<https://github.com/thehappycheese/linrefreverse>

- a python library to convert lat/lon to SLK
  - It is slow and uses loads of ram.
  - It depends on `geopandas` `SpatialIndex.nearest()` which in turn depends on `pygeos` or `rtree`.
    - `geopandas` itself seems to hog tonnes of ram somehow
    - I think i tested and found `rtree` only handles point objects, not lines?? I don't know why it wasn't working
    - pygeos depends on the legendary `GEOS` C++ package. Pretty sure this handled linestrings and did the job nice and fast. But `pygeos` is an optional dependency and you have to set flags in `geopandas` to enable it as the default backend. Don't like.

### 6.2. nicklinref_rust

<https://github.com/thehappycheese/nicklinref_rust>

- A pure Rust web service that converts Road Name & SLK into lat/lon
  - This is super fast, but has the drawback of generating lots of network traffic when not running at localhost, and just generally being difficult to deploy. Also, making web requests can sometimes get in the way of the task at hand.
